## Sample Code examples based on swagger API Documentation
###### Author : Prashant Kumar Singh

###### Uses Swagger maven plugin to generate POJOs and other related code structure to create a spring rest project based on spring boot.


REST application transfers state in form of objects. Now apart from creating the POJOs,it is also required to create and maintain the contract of the REST API to be implemented.

RAML or SWAGGER are the toosl which can be used to create such contract and share among multiple teams to work upon their deliverables while maintaing a single point of truth/reference. Any change made by any team will be immidiately visible to all the partires interested. This also reduces the changes in later stages of development.


In this repository, there are examples of using swagger api files to define an API first and then create code snippets like POJOs , Services etc.
